Atrazine is a herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.

It is one of the most widely used herbicides in the US

It was banned in the European Union in 2004 because of persistent groundwater contamination.
	No MRL in CODEX

In the United States as of 2014, atrazine was the second most widely used herbicide after glyphosate,[1] with 76 million pounds of it applied each year.

Its effect on yields has been estimated from 6% to 1%, with 3–4% being the conclusion of one economics review.

Atrazine degrades in soil primarily by the action of microbes.
