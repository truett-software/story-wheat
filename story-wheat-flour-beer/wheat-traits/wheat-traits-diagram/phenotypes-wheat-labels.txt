Examples of Root Traits Selected by Phenotyping and Incorporated into New Germplasm for Breeders

Traits are selected directly with root phenotyping and/or indirectly with shoot phenotyping.

Examples are restricted to abiotic soil limitations.

Phenotypes for deep water capture have been:

deeper and more extensive root growth selected directly in rhizoboxes
  k [7]
and with field coring
  l [9]
and indirectly with canopy temperature and greenness
  a,b [18,19,21];
and steeper roots (wide angle to soil surface) selected directly in baskets in pots of soil
  i [8].

To conserve water for grain development, a narrow xylem anatomy was directly selected using a macroscope and hand sectioning
  e [10].

Greater yield in drought-prone areas was increased by selecting for thicker tap roots along with optimal leaf width
  g [11].

Greater P use with shallower roots was selected directly on paper pouches
  f [12]
and indirectly with shoot biomass on low P soil
  c [13].
  
Transporters for malate at root tips were identified directly in a solution culture screen, conferring tolerance to acidic and high Al soils
  h [14],
and transporters within roots and the leaf sheath were identified with a shoot screen in controlled conditions
  d [15].
